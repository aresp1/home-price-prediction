# Home Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts California home prices using Python and Linear Regression.
It covers the full machine-learning workflow: data exploration, visualization, model training, evaluation and interpretation.
The dataset comes from scikit-learn’s built-in California Housing dataset, so no external files are needed.
